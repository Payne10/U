# U Project Guide

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a "Life Recorder" system to track daily activities ('Causes') like food, exercise, and medication, and correlate them with their effects on well-being ('Effects') like mood and energy levels. The goal is to use Rust for backend development and machine learning algorithms to analyze cause-and-effect relationships.

## Project Goals
- Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) that captures basic 'Cause' and 'Effect' data.
- Implement a machine learning model to identify patterns and correlations.
- Create an intuitive user interface for data input and review.

## Development Phases
1. **Core Backend Development**: Building the GoLang backend for data handling and basic processing.
2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Applying ML algorithms to the collected data for pattern recognition.
3. **Frontend Development**: Creating a user-friendly interface for data input and visualization.
4. **Testing and Iteration**: Comprehensive testing, user feedback gathering, and iterative improvement.

## Project Management
- **Methodology**: Agile/SCRUM approach, adapted for solo development.
- **Task Management**: Use a Kanban board for task visualization and management.
- **Regular Reviews**: Schedule regular progress reviews and adjust plans as needed.

## Learning Goals
- Gain proficiency in GoLang programming.
- Understand and apply basic machine learning concepts.

## Documentation and Version Control
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of coding practices, design decisions, and learning.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting.

## Community Engagement
- Engage with online communities for GoLang and machine learning for support and code reviews.

## Tools and Resources
- **Project Management**: Tools like Trello or Asana for managing tasks.
- **Learning**: Online tutorials, forums, official GoLang documentation, and coding challenge websites.

## Reminder for Future Self
- Be patient with the learning curve in GoLang and machine learning.
- Stay flexible and adapt the project plan based on ongoing learning and project requirements.
- Regularly reflect on your progress and update the project goals as needed.
